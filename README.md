# Transportation backend repo    2016 - 2017

## Layout

The transDjango directory contains the django application that we're working on.  Some brief instructions on how to install the django application and get the database up and running are in the transDjango Readme.  Please feel free to contribute to those instructions along with the code.

## Contributing

Anyone in the GitHub Transportation 2016-17 team can push to the repository.  If you'r not a member, you can request to be added to the team through GitHub or Slack.  Please follow the [openopensource](http://openopensource.org/) guidelines for contributing to the code base.
